## Troubleshooting
If this program doesn't run on your local machine, you can edit the `dev` command within `package.json`, which looks like:
```
"dev": "http-server ./dist -a localhost -p 8080"
```
If will change the port from `8080` to another port such as `5678` which is normally free for use, you will be able to then visit this in the browser.

Another issue you may come across, such as "This page isn't working", you may need to access `http://localhost:8080/index.html` directly, instead of `http://localhost:8080`.
